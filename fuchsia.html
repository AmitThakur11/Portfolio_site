                    Fuchsia is a new operating system developed by Google, targeting the AArch64 and
                     x86_64 architectures. While little is known about the purpose of this OS and where
                      it will be used, it seems plausible that it aims at replacing Android on smartphones
                       and Chrome OS on laptops.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><h2><strong>Okâ€¦ but how it works?</strong></h2><br>

                    The OS is based on the Zircon (formerly Magenta) kernel, which was derived from 
                    Little Kernel, a tiny embedded OS. Zircon is a significant departure for Google;
                    Android and Chrome, the company's other two operating systems, are both based on
                    the Linux kernel.Google Assistant is fully integrated into Fuchsia's context-aware 
                    environment. For personal computing, that means the assistant knows about recent 
                    activity in the browser and can use that information to guide it in responses. 
                    The OS features capacity-based security, which is based on unforgeable tokens of
                    authority connected to objects which have defined access rights.
