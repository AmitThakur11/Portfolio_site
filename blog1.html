                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Leap Motion is a sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as input, analogous to a mouse, but requires no hand contact or touching.
                        In other words, it’s like Kinect for hands only.
                        Leap Motion is a really smart and small device which looks like below.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ok… but how it works?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                        Under the hood, the Leap Motion is almost the same as Kinect.
                        The heart of the device consists of two cameras and three infrared LEDs. These track infrared light with a wavelength of 850 nanometers, which is outside the visible light spectrum. The collected data is streamed via USB to the Leap Motion tracking software. What’s interesting, thanks to USB 3.0, the range of device increased from 60cm to 80cm, cause of greater voltage.
                        The power of this device is sophisticated software. When data comes, then some heavy mathematical computation starts. Leap Motion doesn’t generate a depth map, it work’s on the raw sensor data.
                        The whole software and hardware description is a topic for another post, so let me know if you want to read more about that.
